# JX's Life Sorting Algorithm

No it's not an actual programmable algorithm :sadface:, but at the very least it will serve as a guide on how to sort my files. Or if I am unavailable or otherwise unreachable, how to navigate the mess of files I have.

File locations (as of 21 Mar 2020):
- PortaTome (4TB 2.5" drive storing recent data)
- PermaTome (4TB 3.5" drive storing older archives)
- PrimeTome (8TB 3.5" drive for 100% redundancy of Porta and Perma Tome)
  - Synced using FreeFileSync
- Knowledgebase (2TB drive storing mostly Anime)
- Storage (4TB drive in desktop storing ???)
- Dropbox (250+GB storing project work prior to uni)
- Google Drive (100GB storing all documents)
- OneDrive (1TB storing misc school work and Audio Entertainment)

## Tome Folder Usage
As of 21 March 2020
| Folder | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| Footage | 1.8TB |
| Work | 462GB|
| Visual Entertainment | 248GB |
| Software | 152GB|
| Personal Projects | 150GB |
| Unsorted | 100GB|
| School | 50GB |
| Bookish | 40GB |
| Audio Education | 16GB |
| Coding | 15GB |
| Pictures | 2.5GB |
| Stock | 1.9GB |

This totals up to almost 4TB, maxing out the space in a single hard drive. This means that from here on out, I'll have to split the data into different hard drives. This is the rough layout of the new storage solution


| PortaTome<br/>(4TB 2.5")< | PermaTome<br/>(4TB 3.5") | Knowledge<br/>(2TB 2.5") |  OneDrive<br/>(1TB Cloud) | PrimeTome<br/>(8TB 3.5") |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Footage<br/>Work<br/>Software<br/>Personal Projects<br/>Unsorted<br/>School<br/>Bookish<br/>Audio Education<br/>Video Projects | Footage Archive<br/>Work Archive<br/>Video Project Archive | Visual Entertainment | Audio Entertainment | PortaTome ⋃ PermaTome ⋃ Knowledge ⋃ OneDrive |

## Folder Structure
All top level folders will have a letter in front of it. This is to identify which drive it belongs to.

Primetome will contain all of the data in one place.

| PortaTome | PermaTome | Knowledge | Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | B | C | Z |


### Footage Structure
All top level folders should follow the following naming convention
```
<year> (<camera>) - <Trip/Album>
```
If no camera is defined, it refers to my main camera (Not phone or gopros)
Within these folders,it can either contain the photos directly, or be sorted further into albums by date.
To be sorted by date, the format is as follows:
```
YYMMDD - <Album Name>
```

Example folder structure
```
- 2014 (Note 2)
  - photo.jpg
  - photo.jpg
  - ...
- 2014
  - 140213 Album 1
    - photo.jpg
    - ...
  - 140215 Album 2
    - photo.jpg
    - ...
  - ...
```

### All Other Folders Structure
The rest of the folders are not consistent, but I try to prepend it with the year.


## Old Folder structure (Tomes)
(Correct as of 2017)
I cannot hope to create the perfect folder structure. But I hope that I will be able to sort my files across all my storage media so that they follow this folder structure. That way there will be a cohesive experience across the board.

## Footage

Photos and videos 
- All photos should be sorted by year, or significant life event
- Folders represent albums and should be in this format `YYMMDD Name`
- Delete jpgs when there are RAW files available.

## Music
- Music sorting seems to work for now
- Keep at it

## Projects

- All projects will be stored in their respective folders.
- There should be no loose file
- Projects that have not been touched for a while should go into an `Archives` folder sorted by year
- Coding projects will probably be on GitHub, but the folders are there anyway

**Example structure**
```
- 3D Works
  - Archives
    - 2016
      - Old  project 1
    - 2017
      - Old project 2
  - Current project 1
  - Current project 2
```
