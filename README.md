# JX's Life Sorting Algorithm

No it's not an actual programmable algorithm :sadface:, but at the very least it will serve as a guide on how to sort my files. Or if I am unavailable or otherwise unreachable, how to navigate the mess of files I have.

File locations (as of 4 Jul 2017):
- The Tomes (2x 4TB drives storing my life's archives)
- Dropbox (250+GB storing project work prior to uni)
- Google Drive (100GB storing all documents)
- OneDrive (1TB storing misc crap)
- Flash Drives (2x 64GB misc file transferring)

## Folder structure (Tomes)

I cannot hope to create the perfect folder structure. But I hope that I will be able to sort my files across all my storage media so that they follow this folder structure. That way there will be a cohesive experience across the board.

> Still missing: How to sort out my documents. Do school documents go into school? What if it's part of project documentation.

## Footage

Photos and videos 
- All photos should be sorted by year, or significant life event
- Folders represent albums and should be in this format `YYMMDD Name`
- Delete jpgs when there are RAW files available.

## Music
- Music sorting seems to work for now
- Keep at it


## Projects

- All projects will be stored in their respective folders.
- There should be no loose file
- Projects that have not been touched for a while should go into an `Archives` folder sorted by year
- Coding projects will probably be on GitHub, but the folders are there anyway

**Example structure**
```
- 3D Works
  - Archives
    - 2016
      - Old  project 1
    - 2017
      - Old project 2
  - Current project 1
  - Current project 2
```
